GitHub user toddmotto maintains [a HUGE list of links to open APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) on many subjects. We _strongly_ recommend that you avoid APIs which require OAuth authentication. APIs which are listed as requiring an apiKey require a _little_ bit of extra work, but this should be documented by the API itself.
